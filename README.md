# HDB
Data Science Final Project
My team selected the topic to predict HDB resale price.
We also studed how distances from school, park, CBD, market, hospitals, sports facilities, age of flat, floor area, storey may affect the selling price of HDB flats.
There are 2 parts to the scripts: 1) to acquire lat and long and data cleansing, 2) machine learning and prediction.
